**AWS CloudFormation uses:**
- Simplify infrastructure management

Imagine you're building a website that needs to handle lots of visitors and has a fancy database. Normally, setting up all the pieces - like making sure there are enough servers, balancing the workload, and setting up the database - can be a bit like solving a puzzle.

But here's the cool part: there's a service called CloudFormation. Think of it as a magical plan for your website. You tell it exactly what you need ,how many servers, where to put the database - and it makes everything happen for you. It's like having a personal assistant that sets up your entire website with just a wave of its digital wand.

And when you're done with your website, you can make everything disappear just as easily. It's like having a magic button to clean up after your online party. With CloudFormation, everything is simpler and works together like a team.

- Quickly replicate your infrastructure

If your application requires additional availability, you might replicate it in multiple regions so that if one region becomes unavailable, your users can still use your application in other regions. The challenge in replicating your application is that it also requires you to replicate your resources. Not only do you need to record all the resources that your application requires, but you must also provision and configure those resources in each region.

Reuse your CloudFormation template to create your resources in a consistent and repeatable manner. To reuse your template, describe your resources once and then provision the same resources over and over in multiple regions.

- Easily control and track changes to your infrastructure

In some cases, you might have underlying resources that you want to upgrade incrementally. For example, you might change to a higher performing instance type in your Auto Scaling launch configuration so that you can reduce the maximum number of instances in your Auto Scaling group. If problems occur after you complete the update, you might need to roll back your infrastructure to the original settings. To do this manually, you not only have to remember which resources were changed, you also have to know what the original settings were.

When you provision your infrastructure with CloudFormation, the CloudFormation template describes exactly what resources are provisioned and their settings. Because these templates are text files, you simply track differences in your templates to track changes to your infrastructure, similar to the way developers control revisions to source code. For example, you can use a version control system with your templates so that you know exactly what changes were made, who made them, and when. If at any point you need to reverse changes to your infrastructure, you can use a previous version of your template.
